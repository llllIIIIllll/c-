====================================================
Source:
    Source elements generate data for use by a pipeline.
====================================================
Filters:
    Filters and filter-like elements have both input and outputs pads. 
    They operate on data that they receive on their input (sink) pads, 
    and will provide data on their output (source) pads.
    e.g. volume element (filter), a video scaler (convertor), an Ogg demuxer or a Vorbis decoder.
====================================================
Sink:
    Sink elements are end points in a media pipeline.
